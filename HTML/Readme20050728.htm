<p><strong>Readme Notes for the Summer 2005 release:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>This is still an intermediate release. Final release planned for end September (for my birthday) whereafter I'll focus on undo/redo, grouping and VS2005/Net2/Avalon. I guess version 3 will be very complete in terms of features. 
</li>
  <li>You will notice in the code that for the first time I've added the code of the <strong>Neon library</strong>, don't expect too much though. I included some samples to highlight some of the features, the best place to look is the Cobalt application however since Neon was written in function of the Cobalt application.</li>
  <li>NDoc compile <a href="..%5Cdocs%5CNetronGraphLibAPI.chm">graphlib API</a> documentation </li>
  <li>The new WordPress Netron site is being <a href="http://netron.sf.net/wp/" target="_blank">rewritten from scratch</a>; cleaner, more streamlined, focused and I dropped obsolete stuff. This is the reason there is very little activity on the current one and the delayed release. </li>
  <li>See the <a href="..%5Cdocs%5CChangeLog.txt" target="_blank">changelog</a> if you wish to upgrade existing code or applications </li>
  <li>Lots of new additions in this preview, highlights are:
      <ul>
        <li>cut/copy/paste</li>
        <li>copy/paste from and to image format</li>
        <li>dragdrop images from file-system </li>
        <li>significantly changed the control-designer of the graph control with initial help for the novices. You can now dragdrop the control on a blank form and press F5 with a working graph-control and the basic shapes. Hints on how to connect events or add custom shapes...it should be really easy now. </li>
        <li>automata stuff re-integrated, making the (old) Automatron app obsolete. I introduced control widgets in this context, they will be more general in next release. </li>
        <li>SVG and HTML export</li>
        <li>the <a href="default.htm" target="_blank">collection of sample diagrams</a>, put a lot of effort in showing all shapes and possibilities. </li>
        <li>re-written z-rendering</li>
        <li>Bezier serialization; see the <a href="Mindmap.htm" target="_self">mindmap sample</a></li>
        <li>new set of flowcharting shapes</li>
        <li>new hypershapes</li>
        <li>ambient properties of the graph control are now serialized </li>
        <li>create image-shape from existing sub-diagrams: you can create and save your own shapes in two clicks now! </li>
        <li> lots more little things everywhere</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thanks for downloading this software and all your support via <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=237527" target=_blank>mail/forum</a>: you make the difference!</li>
</ul>
