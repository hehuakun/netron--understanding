    <td><p>In this collection you'll find a variety of diagrams, (custom) connections and (custom) shapes showing the diversity and possibilities of the current (version 2.2beta) graph library. All the diagrams were created with the Cobalt application and exported to HTML, based on a customizable HTML template. </p>
      <p>The topics covered by these sample diagrams range from serious to idle, from technical to soft and are not necessarily (scientifically) correct. Some diagrams have their origin in commercial diagramming products and were re-produced or re-made in Cobalt without official permissions in the assumption that there is neither an intellectual property attached to nor a copyright on diagrams. The intention was merely to show that the Netron graph library does have the same breadth as commercial products. </p>
      <p>The 'Source' property above the screenshot refers to the location or name of the file under which the diagram was saved. All diagrams will be released together with the final release to enable you to experiment with them. Note that the diagram comments sometimes contain details about certain actions or suggestions (e.g. <em>'use CTRL-A to select all shapes...'</em>) which have no meaning when saved to HTML. </p>
